# Domofon

*Domofon* (ang. *intercom*) is an application created as part of BLStream Front-end Guild in Wroc≈Çaw. It is a continuation of CodeSpace workshops' project.

### What is it for?
This app is supposed to help sending a short notifications to employees in the office, for example, when food they ordered was just delivered or when weekly portion of fruits showed up in the kitchen.  No matter if it's a notification for one specific person or for a whole office, all you have to do is to tap a proper name on the tablet hanging somewhere near the entrance or reception desk and all interested people will get a notifying e-mail.
